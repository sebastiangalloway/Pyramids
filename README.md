# **Pyramids**
- I wanted to make my own iOS app called pyramids and was inspired by the app Finch
- It would be a self care app that visualizes complex tasks in the form of built pyramids
- The goal was to look into some self care strategies that can be gamified and coded
- Completed tasks or efforts would lead to adding bricks to a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and or journey/monument/shrine based pyramid
- Bricks would be sized based on personal difficulty
- Bricks suggestions will be created based on previously completed tasks
- Each brick would have a description and date
- There will be some type of point system that can be spent on raffles for items of different calibers
- Every once in a while enemies will try to siege your monument
- Items earned will protect it and reduce

1. Points and Rewards System:

Assign points to each completed task and allow users to accumulate points for completing tasks. You can introduce rewards, badges, or achievements based on the points earned.
2. Leveling Up:

Create a leveling system where users advance to higher levels as they accumulate more points or complete more tasks. You can display their current level prominently on the screen.
3. Streaks:

Reward users for completing tasks on consecutive days. Display a streak counter that increases daily when users complete a task and resets when they miss a day.
4. Unlockable Features:

Allow users to unlock new features, themes, or customizations as they level up or earn enough points.
