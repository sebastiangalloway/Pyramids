# **Pyramids** 🏗️ (Under Development)

**Pyramids** is a self-care iOS app that gamifies personal growth by visualizing tasks as pyramids. Inspired by *Finch*, this app helps users build healthy habits through engaging mechanics, streaks, and rewards.

## 🌟 Concept

- Tasks are represented as **bricks** in pyramids categorized by **daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and journey-based** progress.
- The **difficulty of tasks** determines the size of each brick.
- **Personalized suggestions** are generated based on previously completed tasks.
- Each brick includes a **description and timestamp** for tracking progress.
- A **point system** allows users to earn rewards through raffles.
- Periodically, **enemies attempt to siege** the user's monument.
- **Items earned** can be used to defend against attacks and reinforce progress.

## 🎮 Gamification Features

### 🏆 Points & Rewards System
- Completing tasks earns points, which can be used to **unlock rewards, badges, or achievements**.
  
### 📈 Leveling System
- Users **level up** by accumulating points or completing more tasks.
- The current level is prominently displayed in the app.

### 🔥 Streaks
- Users are **rewarded for consecutive task completion**.
- A **streak counter** tracks progress and resets upon a missed day.

### 🔓 Unlockable Features
- As users progress, they can unlock **new themes, features, and customization options**.
